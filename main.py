"""

This program uses the Jira API to calculate the total autonomy availability uptime for the Ann Arbor May fleet. 

Uptime is defined as having no more than one Lexus in a non-auto ready state (manual only or grounded) as determined by Jira tickets. This means that any time the GEM goes out of a Monitor status, downtime is accruing. 

100% auto readiness therefore is limited to two cases: where the whole fleet is auto ready, or where only one Lexus is NOT auto ready.


TODO: 
    - Identify those tickets which most severely impact auto-readiness.
    - What about if/when a vehicle is non-auto ready for the WHOLE quarter...?
    - Add a function checkAutoReadiness() that clearly applies auto readiness condition logic so this program can be easily changed for changing definition in future. Currently all of that logic is in computeDowntime()
    - Write test cases for computeDowntime() to make sure it is working as expected.
    - Holidays? 
    - Handle cases where Vehicle State Impact includes 'N/A'. This is the default option for fix on site. Maybe just make this a required field in Jira? Ask Graham.
    - 'Auto readiness' definition will differ slightly be site. Account for this! See point 3. 
    - Add a downtime visualizer? Might be nice.

Given two pandas datetime objects with timestamps in the form ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.XXXXXX'), compute the downtime. Downtime only accrues for business days within the range defined by the bounds [start, end]. The start and end timestamps are generated from Jira ticket update and creation timestamps, so it must be checked that these times fall within normal site operating hours (since we only want to accrue downtime while the site is open for business), and if not, adjust them for the final computation.

The order of operations here are: 
1. find the time delta in business days and convert to seconds, then add to sum deltaT 
2. With the scope of the problem now reduced to difference in time during day, enforce condition that we are only accounting for open operating times
