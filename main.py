This program uses the Jira API to calculate the total autonomy availability uptime for the Ann Arbor May fleet. 

Uptime is defined as having no more than one Lexus in a non-auto ready state (manual only or grounded) as determined by Jira tickets. This means that any time the GEM goes out of a Monitor status, downtime is accruing. 

100% auto readiness therefore is limited to two cases: where the whole fleet is auto ready, or where only one Lexus is NOT auto ready.

TODO: 
    - Handle cases where the ticket is opened in non-auto state and does NOT change state before being closed!
    - Identify those tickets which most severely impact auto-readiness, i.e. has the greatest downtime (could be as simple as finding top 5 elems in sorted list)
    - Add a function checkAutoReadiness() that clearly applies auto readiness condition logic so this program can be easily changed for changing definition in future. Currently all of that logic is in computeDowntime
    - Handle cases where Vehicle State Impact includes 'N/A'. This is the default option for fix on site. Maybe just make this a required field in Jira? Ask Graham.
    - 'Auto readiness' definition will differ slightly be site. Account for this! See point 3. 
    - Add a downtime visualizer? Might be nice. 
    - Add relevant downtime tickets to a dataframe, and allow user to have option to output content to a csv or similar
    - Make terminal output look nicer
    - Add ticket numbers to ignore -- such as when a vehicle is involved in a collision and taken out of service but is grounded in Jira

Given two pandas datetime objects with timestamps in the form ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.XXXXXX'), compute the downtime.
